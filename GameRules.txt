In a graph of length m * n:

	2 players:
		each with a start position and end postion and color
	Equal number of cars each, say 20
	Each car:
		has a path of length k from start position to end position
		does not deviate from path
		cannot hit another car, must wait
		2 states, moving or stationary
		2 colors for 2 different players
	x lights:
		placed at random intersections in the graph
		2 states: green and red
			green starts flow, red stops it
			state changes on click from user
			state change delay (3 seconds?) before can change again

	At start of game:
		All lights are green
		Cars start to flow from respective spawn points(players start position)
	End game:
		When a player gets all of their cars to the end of the path


Questions:
	Are cars spawning from one position for each player, or from random positions?
